(some of the art on these pages aren't technically ascii, just dot art or shift_jis art) ascii is loosely used to refer to internet text based art, but it also has a strict definition. ascii art is defined by the <span>"ascii standard"</span> which consists of 128 characters used to create images.

text art existed long before ascii, people made images using typewriters and wrote paragraphs to be shaped in specific ways. this dates all the way back to ancient greece!
  </p>
  <p>
    ascii art first emerged in the late 1970s when computers were becoming more available. computers were very limited and terminals didn't have image options so people used characters instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    ascii became more and more popular during the early internet and supposedly peaked sometime in the 90s. but it's still used today.

    know this cat? this is <span>Shift_JIS art!</span> i have a couple of these on the website. JIS stands for Japanese Industrial Standards and is a superset of ascii (whatever that means.) like ascii, shift_jis emerged on early websites that didn't have image features. the most famous example is 2channel (which is basically 4 chan so i don't recommend it.) shift_jis is called "aa" for "ascii art" in japan but it changes outside of the country to cause less confusion.
  </p>
  <p>
    shift_jis art is hard for me to find in copy paste form for some reason so i'll add some images here.

    <span>more info on the cat:</span><br>
    mona is probably the most recognizeable ascii character and was born on 2channel from a troll thread. mona has fun catchphrases like <span>omae mona!</span> (“i know you are, but what am i?”) and <span>kimee!</span> (“gross!”). there's also tons of variations and other characters (like giko) and there's even a whole family tree. crazy right
