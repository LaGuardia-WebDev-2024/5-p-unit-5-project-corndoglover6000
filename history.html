(some of the art on these pages aren't technically ascii, just dot art) ascii is loosely used to refer to internet text based art, but it also has a strict definition. ascii art is defined by the "ascii standard" which consists of 128 characters used to create images.

  <p>
text art existed long before ascii, people made images using typewriters and wrote paragraphs to be shaped in specific ways. this dates all the way back to ancient greece!
  </p>
  <p>
    ascii art first emerged in the late 1970s when computers were becoming more available. computers were very limited and terminals didn't have image options so people used characters instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    ascii became more and more popular during the early internet and peaked sometime in the 90s. but it is still used today.
